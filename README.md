## Advent of Code
 
Project [Advent-of-Code](http://adventofcode.com/ "Advent of Code Homepage") has collection of programming challenges glued by interesting background stories.

 Stories are organized as Advent Calendar and are published daily during the [Advent season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent). Each story/unit contains two related challenges.
 At the beginning you have access only to Part-A story/task. After solving the challenge the result (usually simple integer value) 
 is evaluated and upon sucessfull verification the Part-B is revealed. Part-B is always related to Part-A and often
 uses the same input dataset. The educational aspect is that Part-B is more complex than Part-A and it is like generalization of Part-A. 
 If implementation of Part-A is implemented correctly then adding solution for Part-B should be quite straightforward like adding new method or
 additional parameter etc.
 
 The result is mostly simple integer value which is automatically evaluated. However, some units run-time can be in hours. 
 
#### Valuable Features
There are some hard-to-find aspects (a.k.a. valuable featutes) of [Advent-of-Code](http://adventofcode.com/ "Advent of Code Homepage") 
project to consider:

  * interesting & funny
  * two tiers educational aspect as part-a and part-b unit relation
  * xfw (cholesterol free) web pages:
    * no adobe flash
    * no jquery animations
    * no megabytes of javascript crap
    * no cloud-flare, akamai and other cdn garbage
    * zen style minimalistic design (simplicity & functionality first)
    * creative retro ASCII art
  * each task/unit has few testcases
  * personalized input data
  * evaluation of results

#### To Do
Possible future improvements and ideas (in arbitrary order):
* analyze resource requirements [memory, cpu]
* code optimization, profiling
* improved documentation
* implementation in multiple programming languages
* comparision of various implementations

#### History
 version 2017.5 - the initial GitHub release in May 2017
