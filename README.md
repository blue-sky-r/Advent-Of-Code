## Advent of Code
 
Project [Advent-of-Code](http://adventofcode.com/ "Advent of Code Homepage") has collection of programming challenges glued by interesting background stories.

 Stories are organized as Advent Calendar and are published daily. Each story/unit contains two related challenges.
 At the beginning you have access only to Part-A story/task. After solving the challenge the result (usually simple integer value) 
 is evaluated and upon sucessfull verification the Part-B is revealed. Part-B is always related to Part-A and often
 uses the same input dataset. The educational aspect is that PART-B is more complex than Part-A and it is like generalization of Part-A. 
 If implementation of Part-A is implemented correctly then adding solution for Part-B should be quite straightforward like adding new method or
 additional parameter etc.

#### To Do
Possible future improvements and ideas (in arbitrary order):
* analyze resource requirements [memory, cpu]
* code optimization
* improved documentation
* implementation in multiple programming languages

#### History
 version 2017.5 - the initial GitHub release in May 2017
